Overview of the project:
 Project:Develop a Java program to track and manage student grades. The
program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
GPA).
This Java program helps users to track and manage student grades effectively. It allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays the overall performance along with additional information such as the letter grade and GPA.
Features
Input Grades: Users can add grades for various subjects or assignments with error handling for invalid inputs.
Average Calculation: Computes the average grade from the entered data.
Letter Grade Conversion: Converts the average grade into a standard letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).
GPA Conversion: Maps the average grade to a GPA scale (0.0 - 4.0).
Summary Display: Outputs a detailed summary of grades, the average score, letter grade, and GPA.
How It Works
Users are prompted to enter the name and grade for each subject or assignment.
Grades are validated to ensure they are between 0 and 100.
The program calculates the average grade from the entered data.
The average grade is converted to a letter grade and GPA, which are displayed alongside the grade summary.
